## Key Features

- **Consistent with direct ID input**: Same comma-separated syntax
- **Context-aware**: Only shows tasks matching current project/scope filter
- **Bulk or single**: Use "1" for single, "1,3,5" for multiple
- **Easy to cancel**: Just press Enter with no input
- **Clear feedback**: Shows what was selected and summary for bulk ops

## Commands Supporting Bulk Selection

‚úÖ **done** - Mark multiple tasks complete
‚úÖ **rm** - Delete multiple tasks
‚úÖ **mv** - Move multiple tasks to same column
‚úÖ **pull** - Pull multiple tasks into same scope
‚ö†Ô∏è **edit** - Single task only (uses first if multiple selected)
