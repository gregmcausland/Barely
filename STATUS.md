## üöÄ Recent Additions (This Session)

### Persistent Context System ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **Context filtering**: Set current working project and scope
- **Dynamic prompt**: `barely:[Work | today]>` shows active context
- **Smart defaults**: Commands automatically use context
  - `add` creates tasks in current project
  - `ls`, `today`, `week`, `backlog` filter by context
  - Flags can still override context when needed
- **Context commands**:
  - `use <project>` - Set current working project
  - `scope <scope>` - Set current scope filter
  - `use none` / `scope all` - Clear context
- **Session-scoped**: Context resets on REPL restart (by design)

### Smart Interactive Pickers ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **Context-aware task selection**: Pickers filter by current context
- **Inline numbered lists**: Simple, non-intrusive - stays in REPL flow
- **Bulk operations**: Use commas to select multiple (e.g., "1,3,5")
- **Works with all task commands**:
  - `done` - Shows picker for todo tasks (supports bulk)
  - `rm` - Shows picker for all tasks (supports bulk)
  - `edit <title>` - Shows picker, updates selected task (single only)
  - `mv <column>` - Shows picker, moves selected task(s) (supports bulk)
  - `pull <scope>` - Shows picker, pulls selected task(s) (supports bulk)
- **Solves the hundreds-of-tasks problem**: Only shows relevant tasks (up to 20)
- **Example workflow**:
  ```
  barely:[Work]> scope today
  barely:[Work | today]> done
  # Shows numbered list of Work tasks in today scope
  # Enter "1,3,5" to mark multiple as done, or press Enter to cancel
  ```

### ASCII Animations ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **Multi-line canvas animations**: 16x9 character canvas with actual visual effects
- **Firework explosion** (done): Rocket (^) launches from bottom, rises with trail, reaches peak (o), explodes in expanding starburst with ‚úì at center - 16 frames
- **Sparkle burst** (add/done variant): Dot grows to star, checkmark appears at center, particles radiate outward in waves - 11 frames
- **Poof effect** (delete): Block (‚ñà) dissolves through shading (‚ñì‚Üí‚ñí) into dispersing smoke particles
- **Whoosh movement** (pull): Object slides across screen with motion trail
- **Frame-by-frame rendering**: ANSI terminal codes (\033[9A) move cursor up to redraw same area
- **Random variety**: Multiple animation variants per action type
- **Observable duration**: ~2.4 seconds for done (was 0.6s), 0.15s per frame (was 0.08s)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Canvas clears itself after animation completes
- **Bulk operations**: Still use text celebrations like "üöÄ *rapid* üöÄ Completed 5 tasks!"
- **Implementation**: Canvas system with `_create_canvas()`, `_set_pixel()`, `_play_canvas_animation()`
- **Detailed & satisfying**: Doubled duration makes animations truly observable and rewarding

### Improved Output Formatting ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **Project names instead of IDs**: Task tables now show "Work" instead of "1"
- **Efficient caching**: Looks up project names once per display
- **Graceful fallback**: Shows ID if project not found, "-" for no project
- **Better scanning**: Easier to identify task context at a glance
- **Implementation**: `service.get_project()` + display-time cache

### Default REPL Launch
- Running `barely` without arguments now launches the REPL
- Updated help text to reflect this
- REPL is now the primary interface

### Flag and Filter Fixes
- ‚úÖ Fixed --project filtering (now case-insensitive)
- ‚úÖ Removed invalid --json/--raw flags from REPL autocomplete
- ‚úÖ Added --project support to REPL ls command
- ‚úÖ CLI scope commands properly support --json and --raw
- ‚úÖ All flag autocomplete is now command-specific

### Database Migration
- Created and ran migration to add scope column
- All existing tasks migrated to backlog scope
- Migration script available: `run_migration.py`

## üìä Current Capabilities

### What You Can Do Right Now

**Task Management**:
```bash
barely                          # Launch REPL (default)
barely add "Task title"         # Create task in backlog
barely ls                       # List all tasks
barely ls --status todo         # Filter by status
barely ls --project Work        # Filter by project (case-insensitive)
barely done 1,2,3              # Complete multiple tasks
barely rm 5,6,7                # Delete multiple tasks
barely edit 42 "New title"     # Update task title
```

**Pull-Based Workflow**:
```bash
barely backlog                  # View all backlog tasks (50 in your DB)
barely week                     # View this week's commitments
barely today                    # View today's focus list
barely pull 2,4,5 today        # Pull tasks into today
barely pull 7 week             # Pull task into week
barely pull 8 backlog          # Defer task back to backlog
```

**Project Organization**:
```bash
barely project add "Work"       # Create project
barely project ls               # List projects
barely project rm 2,3          # Delete multiple projects
barely mv 5 "In Progress"      # Move task to column
```

**Persistent Context (REPL Only)**:
```bash
barely> use Work                # Set context to Work project
barely:[Work]> add Fix bug      # Creates task in Work automatically
barely:[Work]> scope today      # Filter to today's tasks
barely:[Work | today]> ls       # Shows only Work tasks in today scope
barely:[Work | today]> done     # Picker shows only relevant tasks
barely:[Work | today]> use none # Clear project context
barely:[today]> scope all       # Clear scope filter
barely> ...                     # Back to normal prompt
```

**Smart Pickers (REPL Only)**:
```bash
barely> use Work
barely:[Work]> scope today
barely:[Work | today]> done
# Numbered list appears showing only Work tasks in today scope
# Enter "1" for single, "1,3,5" for multiple, or press Enter to cancel
```

**Traditional REPL Mode** (still works):
```bash
barely> add Buy groceries
barely> ls --project Work
barely> today
barely> pull 1,2,3 today
barely> done 1
barely> help
```

## üéØ What's Next: Phase 7 - REPL Polish (In Progress)

Phase 7 focuses on making the REPL feel great. **Significant progress made this session!**

### Completed This Session ‚úÖ
- [x] **Persistent context system**
  - Set current working project with `use <project>`
  - Set current scope filter with `scope <scope>`
  - Dynamic prompt shows active context
  - All commands respect context automatically

- [x] **Smart interactive pickers**
  - Context-aware task selection
  - Keyboard-driven navigation
  - Works with `done`, `rm`, `edit`, `mv`, `pull` commands
  - Solves hundreds-of-tasks problem with filtering

- [x] **Updated help documentation**
  - Documents picker usage
  - Shows context workflow examples

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Enhanced autocomplete
  - Project names from database (dynamic)
  - Column names from database (dynamic)
  - Task IDs for quick completion

- [ ] Better output formatting
  - Improved table layouts
  - Relative dates ("2 hours ago")
  - Status indicators
  - Project names in task listings (currently shows IDs)

- [ ] REPL helpers
  - `clear` command
  - Status bar showing context (partially done via prompt)

- [ ] Quality of life
  - Undo last operation
  - Better error messages
  - Keyboard shortcuts

### Questions to Consider

1. **What feels clunky in the REPL right now?**
   - Are there workflows that require too many steps?
   - Is autocomplete helpful enough?
   - Is output easy to scan?

2. **What would make daily use better?**
   - Do you find yourself typing the same things repeatedly?
   - Are there common mistakes that could be prevented?
   - What feels slow or tedious?

3. **Should we tackle Phase 7, or is there something else?**
   - Phase 8 is Blitz Mode (focused task completion)
   - Phase 9 is extras (priorities, recurring tasks, etc.)
   - Or address specific pain points first?

## üí≠ Design Philosophy Reminder

From CLAUDE.md:
- **REPL-first**: Interactive shell is primary interface
- **Pull-based**: You control when tasks move through scopes
- **Minimal**: No heavy automation or "smart" systems
- **Local-first**: SQLite, no cloud dependencies
- **Fast feedback**: Everything should feel snappy

**Core tenet**: "When in doubt, build the simplest version first."

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Considerations

None critical! The system is working very well. Some observations:

1. **Display could be richer**
   - ‚úÖ ~~Task tables show project IDs instead of names~~ **FIXED** - now shows names
   - Relative time display would be nice ("3 days ago")
   - Could show task descriptions in listings

2. **Autocomplete could be smarter** ‚ö†Ô∏è Still needed
   - Currently suggests commands and flags
   - Could suggest project names, column names from DB
   - Could suggest task IDs for completion

3. **Error handling is functional but could be friendlier**
   - Current errors are clear but technical
   - Could add suggestions ("Did you mean X?")

4. **No undo functionality** ‚ö†Ô∏è Would be valuable
   - Easy to accidentally delete or complete wrong task
   - Simple undo would be valuable
   - **Note**: Pickers help reduce mistakes by showing what you're selecting

5. **Blitz mode not yet implemented**
   - This was in the original vision
   - Focused task-completion mode within REPL
   - Could be very useful for daily work

6. **Picker limitations** ‚ö†Ô∏è By design
   - Limited to 20 tasks for readability
   - This is intentional - use context filtering to narrow down first

## üí° Suggestions for Next Steps

**Option A: Continue Phase 7 (REPL improvements)**
- ‚úÖ ~~Add persistent context~~ DONE
- ‚úÖ ~~Add inline pickers~~ DONE
- ‚úÖ ~~Improve table formatting (show project names, not IDs)~~ DONE
- ‚è≥ Make autocomplete dynamic (suggest actual project names)
- ‚è≥ Add undo support
- ‚è≥ Better output formatting (relative dates)

**Option B: Jump to Phase 8 (Blitz Mode)**
- Focused task completion mode
- Show one task at a time with timer
- Keybindings for quick actions (d=done, s=skip, q=quit)
- Great for getting through today's list
- **Note**: With pickers and context, this might be less critical now

**Option C: Try it out in real usage**
- The REPL now has powerful context + picker workflow
- Use it for a day to see what still feels clunky
- Come back with real usage feedback
- **Example workflow**:
  1. `use Work` ‚Üí `scope today`
  2. `done` (picker shows only Work tasks in today)
  3. Repeat until done

**My recommendation**: The REPL just got a major upgrade! Try using the context + picker workflow for real work. The combination of `use`/`scope` commands with smart pickers should make managing hundreds of tasks feel effortless. Come back with feedback on what still needs polish.
